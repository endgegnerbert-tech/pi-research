# Changelog

## 1.4.1 (Hotfix)

- **Fixed Bundle Configuration:** Added `ml` directory to `package.json` files array to ensure the Python daemon scripts and local ML models (`.joblib`) are correctly included in the npm published tarball. This ensures the zero-setup architecture functions securely out of the box after fresh installations.

## 1.4.0 (The Agentic Router Update)

This major release transforms `pi-research` from a heuristic-based fetching tool into a blazing-fast, machine-learning-driven research engine explicitly optimized for autonomous AI coding agents. 

By replacing the heavyweight BitNet JSON-planner with the new **Hybrid Tiny-Router Architecture**, agents can now perform hallucination-free, high-quality research with sub-millisecond routing latency—requiring absolute zero setup.

### Added
- **The Tiny-Router (Hybrid Architecture):** Introduced a heavily optimized Node.js-to-Python IPC daemon (`daemon.py`) using `spawn` and line-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0. This handles machine learning tasks via Model2Vec and lightweight ML classifiers without exhausting system resources.
- **Structured ML Capabilities:** Added deterministic "Structured Features" extraction (like `has_authority`, `conflict_state`, `source_count`) for conflict and sufficiency tasks. The router evaluates these features using ultra-fast Logistic Regression, achieving **100% accuracy on unseen Follow-Up task evaluations**.
- **Remote Deploy & Evaluation Scripts:** Added `deploy-server-runtime.sh`, `eval_domain_unknown.py`, and the unyielding `eval_unseen_hard.js` dataset to continuously stress-test the model's accuracy.

### Changed
- **Lightning-Fast Domain Routing:** Replaced slow generative LLM routing with a Model2Vec + SVC classifier.
  - *Performance:* p95 latency is **< 0.6 ms** per query.
  - *Accuracy:* Achieved 0% high-risk downgrades. Security and Paper queries are strictly protected and never downgraded to generic "web" searches.
- **Centralized Retrieval Policy:** Extracted and unified duplicated Blocked/Placeholder detection regexes (`PLACEHOLDER_PATTERNS`) from the ML feature extractor into the core `research-policy.js` to ensure models and heuristics share the exact same rules.
- **Query Planning Engine:** The planning loop is now purely deterministic and heavily leverages the tiny-router hooks instead of generative JSON planning.

### Fixed
- **Follow-Up Search Deadlock:** Hardened `lib/web-research.js` to strictly enforce the Tiny-Router's `stop` decisions. If the model determines that no further sources are needed, the agent gracefully finishes the fetch rounds instead of being overridden by legacy heuristics.
- **High-Risk Veto Power:** Fixed premature loop termination for high-risk domains. The Sufficiency Model now acts as a strict gatekeeper. If a security query only finds blog posts, the model vetos completion and forces a `need_authority` follow-up round to fetch official NIST/CVE data.

### Removed
- **BitNet Deprecation:** Completely removed the legacy BitNet/local-SLM JSON planner dependencies (`lib/local-slm.js`, `lib/local-slm-setup.js`), test files, and CLI commands. `pi-research` is now lighter, more stable, and entirely zero-setup out of the box.

## 1.3.1

### Fixed
- npm `bin` metadata now points to `bin/pi-research.js` and `bin/unblind-mcp.js` so publish no longer warns and strips invalid entries.
- CLI wrapper files are now aligned with npm publish expectations for the next release.

## 1.3.0

### Added
- Retrieval policy document at `docs/policies/pi-research-retrieval-policy.md` to freeze authority, weak-page, and follow-up rules.
- `lib/research-policy.js` with shared authority matrix, weak/blocked thresholds, and deterministic follow-up query builders.
- Regression tests for blocked placeholders, vendor research authority, ResearchGate handling, and search-oriented follow-up queries.
- Deterministic eval cases for weak-page detection, follow-up behavior, and authority checks across `web`, `github`, `security`, and `papers`.

### Changed
- Follow-up queries now stay search-oriented and stop using meta-question phrasing like `Which authoritative source...`.
- Vendor research hosts such as `research.ibm.com` and `research.google` are now classified above generic `other` pages for relevant technical queries.
- Eval runner now reports behavior-based check coverage instead of only counting domain labels.
- Agent-start analytics now log prompt length instead of the full system prompt body.

### Fixed
- Repeated zero-result follow-up loops are now cut short instead of wasting turns on the same dead-end query shape.
- Blocked placeholders such as `Access denied`, `Temporarily Unavailable`, and Cloudflare challenge pages are filtered earlier and no longer treated like normal evidence.
- Unsupported content types such as PDFs now try a targeted fallback path before being dropped as unreadable.
- Cached blocked/placeholder pages are revalidated before reuse.

## 1.2.1

### Added
- Root-level CLI wrappers `pi-research.js` and `unblind-mcp.js` for npm-publish-safe bin targets.
- README install examples for `npm i pi-research`, MCP-only usage, and global CLI usage.
- Tests covering MCP initialize/list/call, package bin aliases, and shim re-export behavior.

### Changed
- Package metadata now exposes both CLI entry points via `bin`.
- README now documents `npm i pi-research`, `node ./mcp/server.js`, `npm run --silent mcp`, and `npx -y pi-research`.
- Public tool name stays `pi-research` for both the Pi extension and the MCP server.
- MCP server branding stays `unblind-mcp` while the shared engine remains in `pi-research`.

### Fixed
- Global npm bin execution works correctly with publish-safe wrapper entrypoints.
- npm install / global bin flow was verified in an isolated packed install.
- npm publish no longer strips the CLI bin targets.

## 1.1.2

### Added
- MCP stdio server at `mcp/server.js` with CLI aliases `pi-research` and `unblind-mcp`.
- Root-level `mcp-server.js` compatibility shim for older local configs.

- Tests covering MCP initialize/list/call, package bin aliases, and shim re-export behavior.

### Changed

- MCP server branding is `unblind-mcp` while the shared engine remains in `pi-research`.
- Package metadata now exposes both CLI entry points via `bin`.
- README now documents `node ./mcp/server.js`, `npm run --silent mcp`, and `npx -y pi-research`.

### Fixed

- Fetch heuristics were tuned to avoid false positives on normal GitHub pages.
- `web-research` now keeps the fast HTTP path first and escalates only when needed.

## 1.1.0

- Output formatting now supports `markdown`, `json`, `table`, and `latex`.
- Community pack starter example at `lib/domains/template.js`.
- README guidance for custom domain packs.
- QA report for the universal research layer review.
